# CompareByMidthElement
A cpp project homework of a 3rd year CS major student.

## Description
- A text file will be read by the program.
- Program will store midth elements of every line
`
For example:
A 2D vector has these as elements.
Vec = { 1 2 3 }
      { 4 5 6 9 8 }
      { 6 8 3 4 1 5 4 }
`
The output will look something like this.
`
3 6 1
4 5 1 2 3 8 6
`
- Reverse the vectors, then swap their midth elements. Basic.
