# CompareByMidthElement
A cpp project homework of a 3rd year CS major student. I wanted to challange myself so got this HW from a friend of mine.

## Description
- A text file will be read by the program.
- Program will store midth elements of every line
```
The text file looks like this :
32 67 98 35 12 65 48 21 98 32 10 96 46 35 98
43 10 91 78 24 26 35 15 79 35 11 35 12
97 89 65 89 23 45 57 
39 68 48 99 12 35 45 45 68 79 31
74 12 16 35 45 68 79 31 54
98 45 68 12 35 74 68 69 12 19 75
```
The output will look something like this.
```
Largest List by Midth Term. Midth Term's location is : 009C2CF4
Largest List by Midth Term Values:
98 35 46 96 10 32 98 89 48 65 12 35 98 67 32
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smallest List by Midth Term. Midth Term's location is : 009BDFD4
Smallest List by Midth Term Values:
57 45 23 21 65 89 97
```
- Reverse the vectors, then swap their midth elements. Basic.
